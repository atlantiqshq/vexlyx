# docker/traefik/acme.json is gitignored, so on a fresh checkout it doesn't
# exist yet. If Docker Compose is left to bind-mount a missing file, it
# auto-creates it as root:root 644 — and Traefik refuses to use an ACME
# storage file that isn't exactly 600, silently disabling the letsencrypt
# resolver (every router referencing it then logs "nonexistent certificate
# resolver"). `touch` is a no-op on an existing file, so this never discards
# real certificate data on a re-run.

# certificate so their first start is reliable while Traefik completes ACME;
# step 14 replaces it with the trusted certificate before install completion.
